This is my project. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Also, it is currently not open source. I'm not sure what I want to do with it in the future, so I'm keeping all my options open.
Yes, there is nothing technically preventing you from taking the source code, except the rule of law. Please don't. Thanks.
